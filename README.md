# Puck - Bash Commander

Puck - Bash Commander is an extension for Visual Studio Code that brings the power of AI to your development environment. It is part of the Puck suite of AI development tools. Bash Commander uses an advanced AI model to help you execute complex development tasks quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- AI-powered shell assistant: Bash Commander is an advanced shell agent that can help you implement tasks, decompose complex tasks into smaller subtasks, and even guide you through the process of completing tasks step-by-step.
- Multilingual support: Bash Commander can output shell commands for any programming language, making it a versatile tool for developers working in various languages and environments.
- Seamless integration with Visual Studio Code: Bash Commander is designed to work within your existing development workflow, integrating seamlessly with Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Puck - Bash Commander extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
2. Configure the extension settings by providing your OpenAI GPT API key and other preferences.
3. Launch the Bash Commander terminal by running the "puck: Bash Commander" command from the command palette.
4. Start interacting with the AI-powered shell agent by entering your development tasks and questions.

## Configuration

Puck - Bash Commander provides several configuration options that you can customize to suit your needs. These settings can be found in the extension settings within Visual Studio Code:

- `puck.apikey`: The API key for the OpenAI GPT service. This is required for the AI-powered shell agent to function.
- `puck.temperature`: The default temperature to use in queries. This affects the creativity of the AI's responses. Higher values result in more creative responses, while lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
- `puck.maxTokens`: The default maximum number of tokens to use in queries. This limits the length of the AI's responses.

## Usage

Once you have installed and configured the Puck - Bash Commander extension, you can start using its features to streamline your development process:

1. Open the Bash Commander terminal by running the "puck: Bash Commander" command from the command palette.
2. Enter your development task or question in the terminal. The AI-powered shell agent will respond with appropriate shell commands, guidance, or follow-up questions.
3. Execute the suggested shell commands, follow the guidance provided, or answer any follow-up questions to complete your task.

## Examples

Here are some example tasks and questions you can try with the Bash Commander:
