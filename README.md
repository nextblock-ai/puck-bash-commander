options that you can customize to suit your needs. These settings can be found in the extension settings within Visual Studio Code:

- `puck.apikey`: The API key for the OpenAI GPT service. This is required for the AI-powered shell agent to function.
- `puck.temperature`: The default temperature to use in queries. This affects the creativity of the AI's responses. Higher values result in more creative responses, while lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
- `puck.maxTokens`: The default maximum number of tokens to use in queries. This limits the length of the AI's responses.

## Usage

Once you have installed and configured the Puck - Bash Commander extension, you can start using its features to streamline your development process:

1. Open the Bash Commander terminal by running the "puck: Bash Commander" command from the command palette.
2. Enter your development task or question in the terminal. The AI-powered shell agent will respond with appropriate shell commands, guidance, or follow-up questions.
3. Execute the suggested shell commands, follow the guidance provided, or answer any follow-up questions to complete your task.

## Examples

Here are some example tasks and questions you can try with the Bash Commander:

- "Create a new Python file called `hello_world.py` and write a Hello World program."
- "Install the `numpy` package using `pip`."
- "Create a new directory called `src` and move all JavaScript files into it."
- "How do I set up a virtual environment for a Python project?"
